## Project Description
A Demo Bank Application written with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).

UI is created with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).  Routing implemented using [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router).
State management is done using [redux](redux.js.org).  Also uses [Material-UI](http://www.material-ui.com/) to make things look attractive :

## Getting Started

Open a terminal / command prompt and run the ``` setup.sh ``` file to install node packages.

The above installs the node dependencies for the main package.json file, along with dependencies for UI projects.

Start the application:

``` npm start ```

The above will start the UI on port 3000.
